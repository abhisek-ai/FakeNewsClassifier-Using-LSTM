# FakeNewsClassifier-Using-LSTM
* Develop a sophisticated deep learning model that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively distinguish between real and fake news articles.
* By utilizing the sequential nature of textual data, our classifier will analyze and extract meaningful patterns to make accurate predictions, contributing to the ongoing efforts to combat the spread of misinformation in the digital age.
